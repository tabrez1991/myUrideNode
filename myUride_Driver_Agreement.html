        <li>Governing Law; Venue and Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.</li>
            
            <p>THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of Law that would result in the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction; provided, however, that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et. seq. shall govern all matters of arbitration law and arbitration procedure in connection with any arbitration conducted pursuant to SECTION 18 below. SUBJECT TO SECTION 18 HEREOF, EACH PARTY CONSENTS AND SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF COMPETENT STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND TO THE VENUE OF SUCH LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, TEXAS."</p>
        </li>
        <li>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration.</li>
            
                <p>18.1 Attempt to Resolve. In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated (a “Dispute”), both you and Company shall attempt in good faith promptly to resolve such dispute. Any party may give the other written notice that a dispute exists (a “Notice of Dispute”). The Notice of Dispute shall include a statement of such disputing party’s position. Within fifteen (15) days of the delivery of the Notice of Dispute, the parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place in Montgomery County, Texas, and thereafter if they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the dispute. All documents and other information or data on which each party relies concerning the dispute shall be furnished or made available on reasonable terms to the other party at or before the first meeting of the parties’ representatives as provided by this paragraph. The meeting described in this paragraph shall be a condition precedent to the commencement of any arbitration proceeding or litigation by either party, provided that this provision shall not apply to any action that (i) seeks injunctive relief or (ii) must be commenced or filed (or not be dismissed) to avoid prejudicing a party’s rights.</p>
            
                <p>18.2 Arbitration. Any dispute if not resolved as provided in Section 18.1, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in Montgomery County, Texas before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be commenced by the claimant filing a demand for arbitration with the administrator of AAA and serving the demand on the opposing Party. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the demand for arbitration is filed, the Parties will select an arbitrator by following the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules’ appointment procedures. Except as may be required by Law, neither Party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this agreement without the prior written consent of both parties.</p>
         
                <p>18.3 Arbitration Binding. The arbitration hearing shall be held in Montgomery County, Texas. The burdens of proof will be as they would be if the dispute were litigated in a judicial proceeding. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the arbitration hearing shall be held not more than sixty (60) days after the appointment of the arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) days following the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator will render a written reasoned opinion setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision reached and will deliver such documents to each party along with a signed copy of the award. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, subject to the court’s authority to modify or review the award as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1 et. seq.</p>
            
                <p>18.4 Fees. The fees and expenses of the arbitration incurred in resolving the dispute shall be borne equally by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event myUride prevails in the arbitration, myUride will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and all costs of the arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator), such fees, costs and expenses to be paid by the non-prevailing party. The arbitrator will be required to make an award of such fees, costs, and expenses to myUride. Nothing in this section shall prevent a party from seeking injunctive relief from a court in any case where such relief is available. Consistent with Section 14 in this Agreement, in no event shall the liability of the company exceed the amount of service fees actually paid or due to the company in the six (6) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to such claim.</p>
            
                <p>18.5 Arbitration is on an Individual Basis Only: Class Action Waiver. THE PARTIES AGREE TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT PERMIT CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ARBITRATOR’S POWER TO RULE ON HIS OR HER OWN JURISDICTION AND THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, THE ARBITRATOR HAS NO POWER TO RULE ON THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN THE EVENT THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATION IS DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL REMAIN IN FORCE.</p>
            
            <p>The parties further agree that if for any reason a claim does not proceed in arbitration, this Class Action Waiver shall remain in effect, and a court may not preside over any action joining, coordinating, or consolidating the claims of multiple individuals against myUride in a single proceeding, except that this Class Action Waiver shall not prevent you or myUride from participating in a classwide, collective, and/or representative settlement of claims. If there is a final judicial determination that any portion of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (i) any class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, and/or representative claims subject to the unenforceable or unlawful portion(s) shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction; (ii) the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration; (iii) the unenforceable or unlawful portion(s) shall be severed from this Arbitration Agreement; and (iv) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful portion(s) shall have no impact whatsoever on the enforceability, applicability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or the arbitrability of any remaining claims asserted by you or myUride. </p>

                <p>19.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-binding. the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions hereof. In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of this Agreement.</p>
            
                <p>19.4 Assignment. Neither party shall assign or transfer this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party; provided that Company may assign or transfer this Agreement or any or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement from time to time without consent: (a) to an affiliate; or (b) to an acquirer of all or substantially all of Company’s business, equity or assets.</p>
            
                <p>19.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all Supplemental Terms, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and replaces and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or undertakings regarding such subject matter. In this Agreement, the words “including” and “include” mean “including, but not limited to.” The recitals form a part of this Agreement.</p>
            
                <p>19.6 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall be interpreted to create any third-party beneficiary claims.</p>
