SEQ. SHALL GOVERN ALL MATTERS OF ARBITRATION LAW AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ARBITRATION CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 8 BELOW. SUBJECT TO SECTION 8 HEREOF, EACH PARTY CONSENTS AND SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF COMPETENT STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND TO THE VENUE OF SUCH LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, TEXAS.</p>
        <li>Dispute Resolution.</li>

        <p>8.1 Arbitration. You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration between you and myUride, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and myUride are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and myUride otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
        <p>8.2 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available online or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
        <p>8.3 Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Texas and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
        <p>8.4 Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and myUride otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in Montgomery County, Texas. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents you and myUride submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing, or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>                        
        <p>8.5 Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorney’s fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.</p>
        <p>8.6 Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.</p>

        <p>9.2 General. You may not assign these Terms without myUride’s prior written approval. myUride may assign these Terms without your consent to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of myUride’s equity, business, or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you, myUride or any Third-Party Provider as a result of this Agreement or use of the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be fully enforced under the law. myUride’s failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by myUride in writing.</p>
