    <h1>myUride Guidelines</h1>
    <p>Our guidelines were developed to help make every experience feel safe, respectful, and positive. They apply to everyone who uses myUride’s Services (“myUride Service”), including but not limited to drivers, riders, and delivery people. It also includes interactions you may have with myUride employees and contractors through online support systems, or over the phone. And, in some instances, our guidelines apply to conduct outside the myUride Service that we become aware of, including but not limited to information from other platforms when such conduct may threaten the safety of the myUride Service.</p>
    <p>Thank you for joining us in supporting and safeguarding a welcoming environment.</p>
    <p>The guidelines below help explain some of the specific kinds of positive community engagement on the myUride Service, as well as the behaviors or circumstances that may cause you to lose access to the myUride Services. There will always be unforeseen events that may ultimately lead to your losing access to using the myUride Services and services, but the following guidelines—which we’ll update regularly—provide the basis for behavior we expect from all in the myUride community. Not following any one of our guidelines can constitute a material breach or violation of the terms of your agreement with myUride and may result in the loss of access to part or all of the myUride Services.</p>
    <p>We update our guidelines regularly to address relevant behavior and risks. Our goal is to ensure that everybody in the myUride community always feels safe and welcome.</p>
    <p>Please take a moment to read them.</p>
    <h4>Guidelines for all of us</h4>
    <p>Everyone who signs up for an myUride account is required to follow myUride’s Guidelines. They reflect the following 3 pillars and the standards in each of these sections.</p>
    <h4>Treat everyone with respect</h4>
    <p>Our community is remarkably diverse and, chances are, you may meet people who may look different from you, think differently than you, or come from different backgrounds. The guidelines in this section help to foster positive interactions during every experience.</p>
    <h4>Help keep one another safe</h4>
    <p>We’re hard at work every day to help create safer experiences for everyone. Your safety drives us. That’s why these standards were written</p>
    <h4>Follow the law</h4>
    <p>We’re committed to following all applicable laws and earning your trust, and we expect everyone who uses the myUride Services to do their part and adhere to relevant laws and regulations.</p>
    <h4>Your feedback matters</h4>
    <p>If something happens, whether it’s good or bad, we make it easy for you to tell us directly in the app or by contacting the myUride Support team. Our team is continually improving our standards and policies, and your feedback is important so that we can take appropriate action to keep our standards relevant as our technology evolves.</p>
    <h4>Treat everyone with respect</h4>
    <p>Treat everyone in the myUride community as you would like to be treated yourself: with respect. The actions you take while using the myUride Services can have a big impact on the safety and comfort of others. Courtesy matters. That’s why you are expected to exercise good judgment and behave decently toward other people when using the myUride Services and interacting with others in the myUride community—just as you would in any public place. This includes behavior toward the myUride support team.</p>
    <p>myUride is an anti-racist company. We are committed to creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone, regardless of background. Remember that when you interact with others in the myUride community, you may meet people who may look different from you, think differently than you, or come from different backgrounds. Please respect those differences. Discrimination based on race or any other characteristic protected by law will not be tolerated on the myUride Services and can result in loss of access to the apps. Additionally, if you witness discrimination taking place, you can report the situation to myUride and we will address any report in accordance with our policies.</p>
    <p>We believe that everyone should feel supported and welcomed when interacting with others in the myUride community. That’s why we’ve created standards and policies on physical contact, sexual assault and misconduct, threatening and rude behavior, post-trip contact, discrimination, and property damage.</p>
    <p>Respect isn’t always tied to what you say, it is also about how you act. For example, always try to be on time for your ride or to pick up your delivery. It’s also common courtesy not to shout, swear, or slam doors. And by tidying up after yourself—whether it’s taking your trash home or cleaning up a spilled drink—you’ll help ensure that everyone has a pleasant ride.</p>
    <h4>Physical contact</h4>
    <p>No one on the myUride Services should be touched without their consent, period. Don’t touch strangers or anyone you just met while using the myUride Services. Hurting or intending to hurt anyone is never allowed.</p>
    <h4>Sexual assault and misconduct</h4>
    <p>We all value our personal space and privacy. It’s OK to chat with other people while remaining respectful. But please don’t comment on someone’s appearance or ask whether they are single. Sexual assault and sexual misconduct of any kind is prohibited. Sexual assault and misconduct refer to sexual contact or behavior without explicit consent of the other person.</p>
    <p>Personal space and privacy should be respected. The following list provides examples of inappropriate conduct but is not exhaustive.</p>
    <ul id="l1">
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not ask personal questions (for example, about relationship status or sexual orientation)</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not comment on appearance (for example, derogatory or “complimentary” comments)</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not make explicit comments or gestures (for example, slurs, or graphic or suggestive messages)</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not flirt (for example, nonverbal, suggestive flirting, or being too physically close)</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not display indecent material (for example, sexually suggestive objects or pictures)</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>myUride has a no-sex rule regardless of whether you know the person, or they give you their consent</p>
    <h4>Threatening and rude behavior</h4>
    <p>Aggressive, confrontational, or harassing behavior is not allowed. Don’t use language, make gestures, or take actions that could be disrespectful, discriminatory, threatening, or inappropriate. The following list provides examples of threatening or rude behavior but is not exhaustive.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not share graphic images or other harmful content (such as those that are sexually explicit or depict violence) with others in the myUride community; this includes unsolicited sharing of such images through myUride’s online support systems or in connection with an myUride Services experience</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Stay away from personal topics that can potentially be divisive, like religion and political beliefs</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not make verbal or physical threats of violence toward anybody</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not use derogatory or discriminatory language, such as racist or prejudiced comments or slurs, for any reason</p>
            <p>If you are the recipient of or witness to any threatening or rude behavior, you can report the situation to myUride, and we will address any report in accordance with our policies.</p>
    <h4>Post-trip contact</h4>
    <p>Contact should end when the trip or delivery is complete unless it’s to return a lost item. Unwanted contact can be seen as harassment and includes, for example, texting, calling, social media contact, visiting, or trying to visit someone in person after a trip or delivery has been completed. Do not share any unnecessary contact information.</p>
    <h4>Discrimination</h4>
    <p>You should always feel safe and welcome. That’s why we don’t tolerate racist or discriminatory conduct and behavior, including toward the myUride Support team. We encourage you to engage in all interactions with empathy, inclusivity, and intent to provide an anti-racist, anti-discriminatory space for everyone. Do not discriminate against someone or engage in a disparaging manner toward someone based on traits such as their race, ethnicity, skin color, age, disability, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, language, geographical location, or any other characteristic protected under relevant law.</p>
    <p>The following list provides examples of discriminatory behavior but is not exhaustive.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not refuse to provide services based on characteristics like a person’s race, ethnicity, skin color, age, disability, gender identity, marital status, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, language, geographical location, or any other characteristic protected under relevant law.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not rate another user—whether drivers, riders, delivery people—based on these traits.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not discriminate based on a rider’s destination or a myUride user’s delivery location. We understand how important it is to fit driving or delivering around your life, rather than the other way around. It is not a violation of these guidelines to decline a trip or delivery because it does not work for you. But intentionally refusing or canceling requests or using features on the myUride Services to avoid receiving trip or delivery requests, solely for the purpose of avoiding a particular neighborhood due to the characteristics of the people or businesses that are located in that area, is not allowed.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Do not use discriminatory language, make discriminatory remarks, vilify, or ask questions about sensitive topics regarding national origin, race, ethnicity, or any other trait previously mentioned. Making racial comments or using slurs is never allowed.</p>
            <p>We also want to help increase the transport options and delivery options for people with disabilities. That’s why we have information available for drivers and riders on this topic. Drivers using the myUride Services must comply with all relevant laws governing the transportation of riders with disabilities, including transporting service animals and assistive devices (such as wheelchairs).</p>
            <p>If you are subject to discrimination or witness discriminatory behavior, you can report the incident to myUride by tapping Help in the apps or visiting help.myUride.com so that our Support team can follow up and take the appropriate action. Call 911 for immediate assistance if you feel like your safety is in danger. myUride takes reports of discriminatory behavior very seriously. Any users found to have engaged in discriminatory behavior or used discriminatory language may lose access to the myUride Services.</p>
    <h4>Property damage</h4>
    <p>Damaging property is never allowed. Some examples include damaging the vehicle or other mode of transportation requested through the myUride Services, breaking or vandalizing a phone or tablet, intentionally spilling food or drink, smoking in a vehicle, or vomiting due to excessive alcohol consumption or otherwise. If you damage property, you’re responsible for the cost of cleaning and repair fees, outside of normal wear and tear.</p>
    <h4>Help keep one another safe</h4>
    <p>Everyone has a role to play in helping to create a safe environment. That’s why we have standards on account sharing, account holder age, and more.</p>
    <h4>Account sharing</h4>
    <p>Account sharing is not allowed. To use the myUride Services, you need to register and maintain an active account. Don’t let another person use your account, and never share your personal information used in connection with your account, including but not limited to username, password, or photos of yourself, with anyone else to access the myUride Services. For example, delivery people must complete all parts of the delivery themselves—including any handling after the item is picked up until final delivery to the myUride user—with no exception.</p>
    <p>People under the age of 18</p>
    <p>You must be 18 years or older to have an myUride account. This means that you must be at least 18 years old to ride unaccompanied in a vehicle. Account holders can’t request a ride or delivery for someone under the age of 18 who will not be accompanied by either the account holder or another adult during the ride or when collecting the delivery.</p>
    <h4>Extra riders and non-account riders</h4>
    <p>When driving with myUride, no one other than the driver, the requesting rider, and the rider’s guests should be in the vehicle. When riding with myUride, the account holder is responsible for the behavior of their entire party. If you request a ride or a delivery for another adult, you’re held responsible for their behavior during their trip or delivery.</p>
    <h4>Vehicle information</h4>
    <p>For an easy pickup or delivery, the myUride Services gives riders identifying information about drivers and delivery people and their vehicles, including their license plate number, vehicle make and model, profile picture, and name. Inaccurate or outdated information creates confusion among riders and can diminish their experience using the myUride Services.</p>
    <p>Drivers and delivery people must complete trips and deliveries using only approved vehicles. To provide accurate information, let us know your vehicle information and provide any updates to your documentation that may become invalid, like a driver’s license that’s about to expire.</p>
    <h4>Seat belts</h4>
    <p>Seat belt use can be the most effective way to save lives and reduce injuries related to vehicle crashes. Every delivery person using a vehicle, every driver, and every rider— including those in the back seat—should always buckle up. Riders should request a vehicle that has enough seat belts for everyone in their party and not travel in large groups that exceed the number of seat belts in the vehicle. Drivers can decline a ride if there are not enough seat belts in their vehicle for every rider.</p>
    <p>Use of dashcams that record video and/or audio</p>
    <p>Drivers may choose to install and use a dashcam, which can be used to record rides and provide evidence to myUride, law enforcement, or insurance companies if something goes wrong on a ride. Please note the following:</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Riders entering a ride matching vehicle with a dashcam may be concerned about how the video, their image, or conversations captured by a dashcam will be used. In some locations, local laws and regulations require that a rider provide consent to being recorded. Please check your local laws to understand your responsibilities.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Drivers may submit recordings to myUride at their discretion. myUride will review submitted footage and take all action consistent with the Guidelines and terms of use.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-list-text=">">
            <p>Sharing or streaming a person’s image or audio or video recording on social media or in other digital or physical public locations is a violation of our Guidelines and may prompt further investigation by our safety team.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>        
    <h4>Be alert</h4>
    <p>Being out on the road means doing your part to help keep yourself and others safe. This means keeping your eyes on the road and being well rested, so you can quickly react to any situation. We review reports of crashes and potentially unsafe driving behavior.</p>
    <h4>Proper maintenance and upkeep</h4>
    <p>Pursuant to the terms of their agreement with myUride, drivers and delivery people are expected to keep their vehicles maintained and in good operating condition, including but not limited to brakes, seat belts, and tires. This means maintaining their vehicle according to industry safety and maintenance standards, and monitoring for and repairing any parts that are recalled by the vehicle manufacturer.</p>
    <h4>Share the road</h4>
    <p>Safe roadways require drivers to practice safe behavior, which includes looking out for all travelers, regardless of how they get around.</p>
    <h4>Public emergencies</h4>
    <p>myUride may take additional measures to try to preserve the safety of our platform during public emergencies, including but not limited to natural disasters, public health emergencies, and public crisis situations.</p>
    <h4>Additional guidelines for myUride delivery people</h4>
    <p>In addition to following all of myUride’s Guidelines, users of the myUride platform must follow the standards below that apply to myUride deliveries.</p>
    <h4>Follow the law</h4>
    <p>We have standards based on applicable laws and regulations that everyone must follow. For example, using the myUride Services to commit any crime—such as transporting drugs, money laundering, committing drug or human trafficking, or sexually exploiting children—or to violate any other law is strictly prohibited.</p>
    <h4>Follow all laws</h4>
    <p>Everyone is responsible for knowing and obeying all applicable laws, including the rules of the road—including complying with traffic laws, signs, and signals—at all times when using the myUride Services.</p>
    <p>All relevant licenses, permits, and any other legal documents required of drivers and delivery people must be kept up to date. For example, all drivers and delivery people using a vehicle are required by law to maintain a valid driver’s license, insurance, and vehicle registration. For ride matching this also includes meeting the applicable regulatory requirements for ride matching or driver matching in your area. We review reports of crashes or traffic citations that may have happened during a trip or delivery, and other reports, including but not limited to those that may indicate poor, unsafe, or distracted driving. Local rules about parking may limit where drivers and delivery people can park their vehicle when picking up items, making deliveries, or waiting for riders to arrive or to exit a vehicle. For example, stopping in bike lanes or blocking accessibility ramps may violate the law.</p>
    <p>For riders let your driver or delivery person handle the driving. For example for riders, don’t touch the steering wheel, and don’t tamper with the gear shift or other knobs, buttons, or components that are used to operate a vehicle. For riders don’t ask a driver or delivery person to speed or to make illegal stops, drop-offs, or maneuvers</p>
    <h4>Service animals and assistive device</h4>
    <p>Drivers using the myUride app may not deny a ride to a rider with a service animal or assistive devices (such as a wheelchair or crutches) because of the service animal or assistive devices. Applicable laws generally prohibit drivers from denying service to riders because of their service animals or assistive devices, and from otherwise discriminating against riders with service animals or assistive devices. Knowingly refusing a rider a trip because of their service animal or assistive devices will result in losing access to the myUride Services. In the US there are no exceptions to this policy, even if a driver has documented allergies, religious objections, or a fear of animals.</p>
    <p>myUride takes reports of discriminatory behavior seriously. Any users found to have engaged in discriminatory behavior or used discriminatory language may lose access to the myUride Services.</p>
    <h4>Drugs and alcohol</h4>
    <p>Drug use and open containers of alcohol are never allowed while using the myUride Services.</p>
    <p>If you’re a driver or delivery person, by law you cannot drive while intoxicated. The law prohibits driving while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any other substance that impairs your ability to safely operate a vehicle or bicycle. If you encounter a rider who is too drunk or rowdy, you have the right to decline the trip for your own safety.</p>
    <p>If you’re a rider and you have reason to believe your driver may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, ask the driver to end the trip immediately. Then exit the vehicle and call 911. Once you have left the vehicle, please also report your experience to myUride</p>
    <h4>Firearms ban</h4>
    <p>Riders and their guests, as well as drivers and delivery people, are prohibited from vehicle carrying firearms while using the myUride Services, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
    <h4>Fraud</h4>
    <p>Deception can weaken trust and be dangerous. Intentionally falsifying information or assuming someone else’s identity, for example when signing in or undergoing a security check, isn’t allowed. It is important to provide accurate information when reporting incidents, creating and accessing your myUride accounts, disputing charges or fees, and requesting credits. Only request fees or refunds that you’re entitled to, and use offers and promotions only as intended. Don’t knowingly complete invalid transactions.</p>
    <p>Fraudulent activity may also include, but not be limited to accepting trip, order, or delivery requests without the intention to complete, including provoking riders to cancel for fraudulent purposes; creating dummy accounts for fraudulent purposes; claiming fraudulent fees or charges, like false cleaning fees; intentionally requesting, accepting, or completing fraudulent or falsified trips or deliveries; claiming to complete a delivery without ever picking up the delivery item; picking up a delivery item but retaining all or a portion of the item, and not delivering the entire item; actions intended to disrupt or manipulate the normal functioning of the myUride Services, including manipulating the settings on a phone to prevent the proper functioning of the platform and the GPS system; abusing promotions and/or not using them for their intended purpose; disputing charges for fraudulent or illegitimate reasons; creating improper duplicate accounts; or falsifying documents, records, or other data for fraudulent purposes</p>
    <h4>Street hails and off-platform pickups</h4>
    <p>To enhance the safety of each experience, off-platform pickups are prohibited. The law prohibits street hails while using the myUride Services, so never solicit or accept payment outside the myUride Services. Riders should not pay for trips or deliveries in cash, and riders should not request trips from drivers outside of the myUride Services.</p>
    <h4>Other unacceptable activities</h4>
    <p>Never use myUride’s trademark or intellectual property without permission. If it’s required under local law to display myUride-branded items, drivers and delivery people should only use myUride-branded items that are obtained from myUride. Drivers and delivery people should not display myUride-branded items when they are not accessing the platform. Drivers and delivery people should also return myUride-branded items to myUride if they lose access to the platform.</p>
    <h4>Your feedback matters</h4>
    <p>If something happens, whether it’s good or bad, we make it easy for you to tell us. Our team is continually improving our standards, and your feedback is important to keep our standards relevant as our technology evolves. Please rate your experience at the end of each trip or delivery. Honest feedback helps ensure that everyone is accountable for their behavior. This accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment. In case of an emergency or if you find yourself in immediate danger, alert your local authorities or emergency services before notifying myUride.</p>
    <h4>Delivery, order, and trip acceptance</h4>
    <p>If you’re a delivery person or driver and you don’t want to accept delivery or trip requests, you can just go offline or log off or decline the drive or delivery request.</p>
    <h4>How myUride enforces our guidelines</h4>
    <p>Losing access to the myUride Services may be disruptive to your life. That’s why we believe it is important to have clear standards that explain the circumstances in which you may lose access to the myUride Services. If you violate any terms of your contractual agreement with myUride, or any applicable terms or policies, including any one of these Guidelines or any additional policies and standards that are communicated by myUride to you from time to time, you can lose access to all or part of the myUride Services. If you have more than one myUride account, such as a rider account and a driver account, violating the Guidelines could also lead you to lose access to all myUride accounts. If you believe an error caused you to lose access to your account, you may contact the myUride Support team.</p>
    <p>myUride receives feedback through a variety of channels, reviews reports submitted to our Support team that may violate our Guidelines and may investigate through a specialized team. If we are made aware of potentially problematic behavior, we may contact you so we can look into it. We may, at our sole discretion, put a hold on your account or turn your account inactive until our review is complete.</p>
    <p>Not following any one of our guidelines may result in the loss of access to all or part of the myUride Services. This can include reported violations of our Guidelines and certain actions you may take outside of the myUride Services, including but not limited to information from other platforms, if we determine that those actions threaten the safety of the myUride community, our employees, and contractors, or cause harm to myUride’s brand, reputation, or business. And if the issues raised are serious or a repeat report, or you refuse to cooperate, you may lose access to the myUride Services. Any behavior involving discrimination, violence, sexual misconduct, harassment, fraud, or deceptive,illegal, or unsafe activity, while using the myUride Services can result in the immediate loss of access to the myUride Services. Additionally, when law enforcement is involved, we will cooperate with their investigation in accordance with our Guidelines.</p>
    <p>Many states and cities regulate the provision of certain services, including ride matching services, on the myUride Services. If we determine that your driver or delivery person account is not in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be required to remove your access to the myUride Services.</p>
    <p>Lastly, all drivers and delivery people wanting to use the myUride Services undergo a screening process, including motor vehicle record and criminal background checks. A driver or delivery person will lose access to their myUride account(s) if a motor vehicle record check, criminal background check, or other check uncovers a violation of myUride’s Guidelines or other criteria required by local regulators.</p>
    <p>Note: Drivers and delivery people are not agents (actual, ostensible, or otherwise) or employees of myUride. Drivers and delivery people do not act pursuant to any authority (actual, apparent, or otherwise). They are independent third-party providers</p>
